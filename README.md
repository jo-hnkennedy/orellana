orellana - navigator of amazon emr log files

francisco de orellana - first known navigator of entire amazon river

making the world a better place by syncing log files from amazon EMR clusters to windows boxes

prerequisites:

    Python
  
    Putty

    an Amazon EMR cluster already set up
  
run orellana_installer.py - it will ask for a Putty session_name and the ip of the master node on cluster

will create directory c:\users\orellana

future functionality (maybe):

      creates a web server with the logs on a remote server so no network transfer is needed
